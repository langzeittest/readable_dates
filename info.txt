title: Readable Dates and Concealed Times
desc: Make dates easier to read for humans, by using relative indications like "two hours ago", "yesterday, 12:30", "today, 17:52", "two weeks ago", "last year", etc. Conceals message timestamp for messages older than 24 hours. Don't let your boss know that you wrote at work ... All date indications can be customized through the language files.
